# Comparative Genomics

Welcome to Comparative Genomics github repository. Here are reported all directories that resumes an enitre workflow course of Unibo, University of Bologna.
During this semester we focused on learning assembly and comparative inference skills using lots of bioinformatic tools. This repository documents a dual-phase genomic analysis centered on the invasive malaria vector *Anopheles stephensi*. We conducted a genome assembly on *A. stephensi* and a multi-species study involving 6 distinct Culicidae genomes selected from diverse thermal niches. By contrasting temperate lineages against tropical counterparts, we aim to detect genomic signatures of cold adaptation. 
Every folder reports a specific passage, click on titles to figure out what we have done!
